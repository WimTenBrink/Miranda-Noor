# Noor: A World of Our Own Making

We are Miranda Noor and Annelies Brink, partners in life, music, and art. Our shared world is built on a small, secluded farm in the Netherlands—a sanctuary where we create, dream, and coexist with the rhythms of nature. It is here, in this haven of our own making, that the disparate threads of our individual journeys are woven together into a single, shared story: Miranda's global heritage and Annelies's deep-seated Dutch roots.

Our band, **"Noor,"** is the vessel for our stories. The name, taken from Miranda's surname, means "light" in Arabic—a guiding principle for our music, which aims to illuminate the multifaceted human experience. Our sound is an intimate blend of narrative folk and structured poetry, a direct reflection of our respective artistic strengths. It all comes together in our on-farm music studio, a space dedicated to collaboration and authentic expression.

## Core Themes in Our Art

Our work is a continuous, shared exploration of the ideas, struggles, and joys that define us and our generation. These core themes are the pillars of our creative output:

*   **Identity & Belonging:** We delve into the complexities of navigating a mixed-race, multilingual, and multicultural identity in a world that often prefers simple, unambiguous labels.
*   **Love & Resilience:** Our music celebrates the deep, foundational bond between us as partners, as well as the family ties that shape our capacity for love and endurance.
*   **Celebrating the LGBTQ+ Community:** We are committed to championing visibility, acceptance, and the radical freedom to be authentic in every aspect of life.
*   **Grief & Memory:** Our songs often serve as a way to honor the profound impact of those we've lost, transforming grief into a testament to the strength found in resilience.
*   **Creativity as a Lifeline:** For us, art is not a hobby but an essential tool—a way to process the world, express our truths, and connect with others on a deeper level.
*   **Social Consciousness:** As we navigate our path into adulthood, we use our voices to engage with feminism, female rights, and other pressing social issues that shape our future.

This is our corner of the world, shared with love and creativity.
